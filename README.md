# School District Analysis

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project is to analyze school district data and uncover trends in school performance using Pyhton and Pandas. More specifically, the school board has found evidence of academic dishonesty for math and reading grades at Thomas High School. In order to uphold their state-testing standards, this project was conducted to replace the grades from Thomas High School. The analysis conducted wil help determine how the suspected academic dishonety affects school performance.

## Results

Removing 9th grade student scores from Thomas High School affected the rest of the school district in the following ways:

- Total Students: Remained unchanged
- Total Budget: Remained unchanged
- % Overall Passing: Took a very slight decline by 0.1%
- % Passing Math: Took a very slight decline by 0.2%
- % Passing Reading: Took a very slight decline by 0.3%
- Average Math Score: Took a very slight decline by 0.1%
- Average Reading Score: Remained unchanged

What it clear from this information is that removing the math and reading grades from 9th graders at Thomas High School had an insignificant impact on the overall performance of the school district.
